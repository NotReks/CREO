## üìù Notes

- Only **64x64 Minecraft skins** are supported for automatic conversion.  
- If the skin is blurry after creation then manually upscale it 16x.
- If you have trouble with the texture, edit the resolution to be 1024x1023.
- if the upscaler doesn't work (Your skin is all blurry) go to https://lospec.com/pixel-art-scaler/ to upscale it 16x to 1024x1024
