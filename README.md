## üìÇ Folder Setup

- **`textureHere/`**  
  Place your texture here.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Put your texture inside `textureHere/`.
2. Run **`makeModSteve.bat`** or **`makeModAlex.bat`**.  
   - Make sure you name the png file for Steve "SonicBoomMinecraftMod"
   - Make sure you name the png file for Alex "Alya"
   - Make sure you drag the z_FixAlex_P.pak,utoc,ucas from the Dependencies folder to your ~Mods folder too because fuck me python wants to be stupid

---

## üì¶ Output

- The resulting mod will be generated in the `resultingMod/` folder with the dependency fixes once you run one of the batch files.

---

## üìù Notes

- Only **64x64 Minecraft skins** are supported for automatic conversion.  
- If the skin is blurry after creation then manually upscale it 16x.
- If you have trouble with the texture, edit the resolution to be 1024x1023.
